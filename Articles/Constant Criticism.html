			<div>This mental health issue can be treated much to our delight; like for <b>medication</b>, there are the <em>SSRIs</em> (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) such as sertraline (Zoloft) and fluoxetine (Prozac), which are effective in treating anxiety, and there are also the <em>benzodiazepines</em>, which are mostly for short-term relief of acute anxiety symptoms, like lorazepam (Ativan), but these should be used cautiously due to the fact of the risk of dependency. But that was for the medication part. There are still treatments that we could do in the form of our <b>lifestyle</b>, such as <em>regular exercise</em>, as it can significantly reduce anxiety levels, and <em>stress management techniques</em> where one could incorporate relaxation techniques into one's everyday routine.</div><br><br>

			<div>Increased anxiety levels or more frequent and severe panic attacks are two outcomes of <b>untreated anxiety disorders</b>. People may develop avoidance behaviors, avoiding locations or circumstances that make them anxious, which might restrict their possibilities and activities. Numerous physical health conditions, such as gastrointestinal and cardiovascular illnesses, are also linked to chronic worry. Moreover, untreated anxiety can exacerbate people's problems by causing co-occurring disorders like substance misuse or depression to emerge.</div><br><br>
