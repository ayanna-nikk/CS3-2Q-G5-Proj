			<div>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) can cause symptoms to increase over time, with <b>compulsions and obsessions</b> becoming more intense if treatment is not received. Increased distress and severe impairment in day-to-day functioning may arise from this escalation, making it challenging for people to finish daily chores or uphold relationships. As people struggle to manage their symptoms, untreated OCD can also result in the emergence of other mental health conditions like depression or anxiety disorders. Social isolation can also happen when people avoid social interactions and connections out of fear of being judged or misunderstood by others.</div><br><br>
