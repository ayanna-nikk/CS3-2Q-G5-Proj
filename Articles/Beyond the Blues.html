				<div><b>Depression</b> is a mood disorder that is defined as a “loss of interest” and can seriously impact one’s life. It affects about 280 million people worldwide, which is 3.5% of the population. This disorder can affect you emotionally, physically, and cognitively.</div><br><br>

				<div><h2>What are the symptoms?</h2></div><br><br>

				<div>Symptoms that one could feel <b>emotionally</b> are persistent sadness, anxiety, emptiness, irritability, frustration, or restlessness. <b>Physical</b> symptoms are fatigue, changes in appetite, sleep disturbances, aches, and pains. And finally, your <b>cognitive function</b> can experience unfocus, indecisiveness, negative thoughts, and thoughts of death or suicide.</div><br><br>

			<article>
				<div><h2>Possible Causes</h2></div><br><br>
				
				<div>One common cause is that witnessing <b>trauma</b>, especially abuse, can potentially have a higher risk of putting themselves into psychological emptiness. <b>Substance abuse</b> is also a cause of depression, as drugs possess depressants that contribute to one’s perspective in life negatively. The last common cause is <b>stressful events</b>, whereas these events can pile up and destroy one’s emotional mind, forcing one to go into depression.</div><br><br>

			<div>But this disorder can be treated. One treatment is <b>medication</b>, where <em>antidepressants</em> such as SSRIs like sertraline (Zoloft) and fluoxetine (Prozac) are commonly prescribed. Other options include <em>SNRIs</em> (e.g., venlafaxine) and <em>atypical antidepressants</em> (e.g., bupropion). Another treatment is the changes to the <b>lifestyle</b>; starting with <em>regular exercise</em> as it can help alleviate symptoms of depression and improve one's mood; a <em>healthy diet</em> is also recommended; a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can support your mental health; and last but not least is <em>sleep hygiene</em>; having good sleep habits, such as a regular sleep schedule and a restful environment, can improve mood and energy levels.</div><br><br>

		<article class="lastones">
			<div>Depression symptoms might increase if treatment is not received, resulting in <em>enduring depressive, hopeless, and worthless feelings</em>. A person's capacity to work, learn, and carry out everyday tasks may be seriously hampered by this decline, which may lead to a <em>loss of employment</em> or <em>academic failure</em>. Feelings of <em>loneliness and social isolation</em> can result from strained relationships with family and friends. Untreated depression has also been connected to <b>several physical health issues</b>, such as <em>heart disease</em> and <em>chronic pain</em>. Untreated depression in extreme circumstances can result in <em>suicidal or self-harming thoughts</em>, underscoring the vital significance of early intervention and treatment seeking to enhance general well-being.</div><br><br>
