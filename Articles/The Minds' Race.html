				<div><h2>What is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder?</h2></div><br><br>

				<div><b>ADHD</b>, or <b>attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</b>, is an illness that makes people prone to impulsive actions, energy, and having high stress or anxiety levels. This can hinder a person’s ability to do activities like work and school and can inflict or lead to depression. There are <em>no specific causes</em> that trigger ADHD, but several risk factors may affect it; this includes a <em>history of ADHD</em> and <em>exposure to alcohol and tobacco</em>. ADHD symptoms can be seen through <b>hyperactivity</b> and <b>impulsivity</b>, or <b>lack of attention/inattention</b>.</div><br><br>

				<div><h2>What are the symptoms?</h2></div><br><br>

				<div><b>Inattention/lack of attention affects</b> people by giving them an unorganized mindset, which causes struggles and difficulties in paying attention and being attentive. Examples of this are: daydreaming or being easily distracted; difficulties staying on topic or paying attention; finding it hard to follow instructions; and being careless and incautious.
				<b>Hyperactivity</b> and <b>impulsivity</b> are two symptoms that can be seen in a patient with ADHD; they are defined as: hyperactivity—being hyperactive, or, in other words, showing signs of restlessness and having difficulties staying in place or always moving. Examples of hyperactivity include excessive fidgeting or tapping of fingers, hands, or feet; trouble being quiet; often losing stuff; always "on the go"; and psychomotor agitation. And impulsiveness—the opposite of self-control. ADHD patients may struggle with being mindful and are unable to think before they act. Examples of impulsivity include: easily angered; bunging; oversharing; and struggling to control emotions.</div><br><br>

			<div>We have found ways, approaches, and medications to help patients with this illness. Because in this world no one is allowed to suffer alone in the arms of ADHD. We plan to consider some ways. Such as <b>therapy</b>, simple counseling can help a lot in terms of understanding the situation. Seeking therapy will ensure a safe space to build a mutual relationship with the patients. It could also be in the form of <b>medications</b>; we support a few medications, but it’s better to consult an actual doctor according to your illnesses to avoid medication intake errors. These can vary if you use stimulants or non-stimulants. Stimulants are quick, easy, and the most common fix, while non-stimulants take long periods of time to take effect. Stimulants include methylphenidate (Concerta, Daytrana, etc.) and amphetamines (Adderall, Dexedrine, etc.), while non-stimulants include clonidine and guanfacine.</div><br><br>
