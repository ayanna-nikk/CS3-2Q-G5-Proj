				<div><h2>What is Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder?</h2></div><br><br>

				<div><b>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</b> is a complex and debilitating mental health condition triggered by witnessing or experiencing traumatic events. The condition affects millions worldwide, causing significant emotional distress, impaired relationships, and decreased quality of life.
				There are two primary types of PTSD: acute and complex. <b>Acute PTSD</b>, a short-term condition, results from a single traumatic event lasting less than three months. In contrast, <b>complex PTSD</b> stems from protracted or repeated traumatic experiences, leading to prolonged emotional dysregulation, dissociation, and self-destructive behaviors. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for effective diagnosis and treatment.</div><br><br>

				<div><b>PTSD symptoms</b> include intrusive memories, flashbacks, nightmares, avoidance behaviors, hypervigilance, and emotional numbing. Mood changes, depression, anxiety, and irritability further exacerbate symptoms. If left untreated, PTSD leads to substance abuse, relationship problems, chronic anxiety/depression, and suicidal thoughts.</div><br><br>
